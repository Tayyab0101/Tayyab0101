- 👋 Hey there! I'm Tayyab Usman, a Computer Science graduate from UET Lahore (class of 2021). With a passion for technology, I'm on a journey to build a solid foundation in QA while also making strides towards becoming a proficient Python developer.
- 👀 I'm fascinated by the intricacies of software development and quality assurance processes. Currently, I'm immersing myself in various Python libraries and exploring Docker to deepen my understanding of backend development.
- 🌱 Apart from my technical pursuits, I'm an avid problem-solver, always eager to dive into complex issues and find innovative solutions. I believe collaboration is key, and I'm excited about the prospect of working with like-minded individuals on projects that make a real-world impact.
- 💞️ If you're interested in teaming up on test cases or Python-related endeavors, I'd love to connect and brainstorm ideas!
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at tayyabusman7860@gmail.com to discuss potential collaborations or just to geek out over the latest tech trends.
